# Programmers : Jincy Njenga
# Course: CS 151, Dr. Kenyon
# Due Date 4/12/23
# Lab Assignment: 5
# Problem Statement: adds or removes words from list based on user input
# Data In: letter, index, and number of vowels
# Data Out: list of words containing user specified letter
# Credits:https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp and in class examples
